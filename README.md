## Introduction 
With an increase in the standard of living, humans gradually shifted their attention towards fashion, which is considered to be a popular aesthetic. In recent years, the textile and fashion industries have witnessed an enormous amount of growth in fast fashion. People see others donning a certain outfit and want to buy similar if not the same kind of clothing. To facilitate this, a recommendation system is required. The main challenge in building a fashion recommendation system is that it is a very dynamic industry. In essence, this is a product recommendation system set in the domain of fashion. 

## Data 
The dataset has been obtained from UCI repository. It contains 44424 diverse fashion images. 

## Problem Statement 
To be able to recommend products similar to the picture uploaded. 

## Methodology in Brief
- Deep Learning forms the basis of the methodology for this project.
- The coding is carried out in Python.
- CNN and Transfer Learning Models are used to help classify the images.
- Since Transfer Learning is used, there is no actual training of the data. Furthermore, ResNet50 and ImageNet are used to facilitate the Transfer Learning.
- Various libraries as required are added onto the project.
- An image is uploaded. The goal of the project is that it returns similar products to the one that is uploaded.
